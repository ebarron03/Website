      <h4>About Me</h4>
      <p>Howdy! My name is Ernest Barron, and I am an undergraduate student at
         Texas A&M University currently pursuing a Bachelor`s degree in 
         Computer Science. My curiosity for how things work has driven my 
         choice in this academic and career path. I am passionate about 
         utilizing technology to create meaningful software, solve complex 
         problems and contribute to the evolving world of artificial 
         intelligence, particularly its applications in everyday life.
          <br><br>
         Throughout my coursework, I have developed a solid foundation in 
         computer science and hands-on programming experience working with 
         languages such as C/C++, Java, Haskell, Python. Some of my favorite 
         academic projects include implementing Abstract Data Types found in 
         the C standard library, like stack, linked list, binary search trees, 
         and unordered maps. I also designed and built a basic banking system 
         that utilized concepts of interprocess communication using pipes, 
         signal handling, thread synchronization, and network programming 
         as well as introductory RSA encryption. These projects challenged my 
         problem solving skills and solidified my interest in systems-level 
         development.
         <br><br>

         Outside of academics, I work part-time with Academy Sports + Outdoors. 
         This role has helped me develop essential soft skills, such as 
         communication, teamwork, and customer service, skills I believe will 
         serve me well in the technical field. Balancing work and school has 
         also taught me to manage my time more effectively and stay organized 
         under pressure.
          <br><br>

         In my downtime, I like to unwind by diving into fantasy novels, 
         writing stories, and playing indie horror games. I also have a soft 
         spot for anime and situation comedy television shows. 
         They are my go-to form of stress relief.
          <br><br>
         I am currently seeking opportunities to gain hands-on experience 
         in the software industry, whether through internships, research, or 
         collaborative projects. If you are a recruiter, developer, or researcher 
         looking to work with a driven and curious student, I would love to connect!
