            <p><em>The Joshua Allen Hebel Memorial Scholarship Fund is a nonprofit organization that raises money to provide local scholarships to students in need.
                The fund was established in memory of Joshua, a beloved member of the Palacios community.
                I have volunteered with the 5k Color Run by setting up, cleaning up, helping with concessions, and handing out water to runners.
                I was honored to receive a scholarship from this fund for the 2022-2023 academic year.

            <br>
            <p><em>Uriah's Legacy Foundation is a community-driven organization dedicated to supporting families in need. 
                The foundation provides nonperishable items to families facing food insecurity, as well as educational resources for children.
                Uriah's Legacy operates a Blessing Box, which is a free pantry where community members can take what they need and leave what they can.
                I plan to further support the fundraiser by creating a website.
